My screeps code

## Development environment

I am using PhpStorm under Linux Mint (/Ubuntu/Debian).
What you need to code with screeps cleanly :

* Install node.js version 6.2+ :
    * Download from nodejs.org,
    * untar with tar xz,
    * move the node-<tab> folder into /opt/,
    * ln -s /opt/node-<tab> /opt/node to get a short easy to configure name

* Enable node.js code assistance into PhpStorm :
Search nodejs into settings : path is /opt/node/bin/node, choose path for npm, activate code assistance

* Add those external libraries do get it all work :
    * lodash : from PhpStorm javascript typescript community stubs downloads
    * ScreepsAutocomplete : git clone https://github.com/tickleman/ScreepsAutocomplete
