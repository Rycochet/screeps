My screeps code

## Development environment

I am using PhpStorm. What you need to code with screeps cleanly :

* Install node.js version 6.2+ :
Download from nodejs.org, untar with tarxz, move folder into /opt/, ln -s folder for /opt/node

* Enable node.js and assistance into PhpStorm :
Search nodejs into settings

* Add those external libraries :
** lodash : from PhpStorm javascript typescript community stubs downloads
** ScreepsAutocomplete : git clone https://github.com/tickleman/ScreepsAutocomplete
